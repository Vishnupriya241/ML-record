AIM:
 To implement data analytics using python.
DESCRIPTION:
 Python has a unique attribute and easy to use when it comes to quantitative and 
analytical computing.
 Time spent on debugging codes and on various software engineering constraints are also 
minimized.
 The time for code implementation is less which has developed and software engineers to 
spend more time to work in their algorithms.
 Python provides a massive database of libraries and artificial intelligence and machine 
learning.
1.Finding Factorial of a number
#take input from the user
num = as.integer(readline(prompt="Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
#check is the number is negative, positive or zero
if(num<0)
{
 print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
}
else if(num==0)
{
 print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
}
else
{
 for(i in 1:num)
 {
 factorial=factorial*i
 }
 print(paste("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial))
}
OUTPUT:
Enter a number: 8
[1] “The factorial of 6 is 720”



2.To check Prime Number
# Program to check if the input number is prime or not
# take input from the user
num=as.integer(readline(prompt="Enter a number: "))
flag=0
if(num>1)
{ 
 flag=1
 for(i in 2:(num-1))
 {
 if((num%%i)==0)
 {
 flag=0
 break
 }
 }}
if(num==2)
 flag=1
if(flag==1)
{
 print(paste(num,"is a prime number"))
}
else
{
 print(paste(num,"is not a prime number"))
} 5
OUTPUT:
Enter a number: 25
[1] “15 is not a prime number”
Enter a number: 13
[1] “13 is a prime number”
